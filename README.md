# Exe_Simmi_Improved
Better (working) Version of Exe_Simmi

# TODO
* check Simmmi's properties to see what is wrong
* Migration script for properties files
  * underscore to camelcase
  * discord bot config hex color: with # -> without #
  * twitch bot config: remove "onlyMods"
  * check more


# Future TODOs
* rework twitch bot config (why do we save a single emote? we don't really reuse that. Maybe see if we can put the whole messages as a property.)
* Check all properties and their functionality
